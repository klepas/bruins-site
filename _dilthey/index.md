## Introduction

Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) is an early contributor to what has come to be known as the philosophy of the social sciences and of the human sciences (_Geisteswissenschaften_) more generally, i.e., all those forms of theoretical inquiry which are not and, according to Dilthey at least, cannot be scientific in the way in which, say, physics is scientific: philology, historiography, philology, psychology, sociology, economics, etc. But according to Dilthey this does not mean that these disciplines are not scientific in their own distinctive way and it is indeed Dilthey’s life-long endeavour to identify and justify this way. Although Dilthey has had a significant impact on later thinkers, e.g., Husserl, Heidegger and Gadamer; and although there is a growing interest in Dilthey in English-speaking countries, much of his work remains untranslated and there is still not all that much secondary literature on him.<br><br>These notes were used as the basis of a half-semester course which formed the latter half of the second year unit “European Philosophy A” in 1996 and in 1998. They have not been revised since then.
