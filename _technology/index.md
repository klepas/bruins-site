## Introduction

In this option, which first ran in first semester, 1993, I asked just what technology is, in what ways it effects us and just how much of a good thing it is. I looked at the views of a few authors who have already addressed this question. I also examined two spectacular failures of technological systems, namely, the shooting down of _Iran Air Flight 655_ by the _U.S.S. Vincennes_ and the _Challenger_ disaster, in order to pose questions concerning the nature and limits of technological control. The question was raised as to whether the increasing complexity which sophisticated technology makes possible is a threat to traditional political ideals such as democratic participation in the political process, the desirability and possibility of a steerable human society governed by substantial normative and ethical visions. Finally, I looked at notions of appropriate/alternative technology in order to see whether there are alternative “philosophies”of technological design and implementation.<br><br/>Two videos were used in connection with the option, viz., _On the Eighth Day_ and _Whatever happened to **Star Wars**_. The first looks at how technologies for overcoming infertility use women as guinea pigs for trialling and improving the technologies themselves. The second details the rise and fall of Ronald Reagan's _Strategic Defense Initiative_, revealing in the process something of the politics of large-scale technological projects.<br><br/>These notes were written in 1993 and updated across 1994 and 1995. Since then I have only made some slight changes to them. Some of my views have of course changed since I first wrote and updated them.
