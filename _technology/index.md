## Introduction

In the six-week First Year option _Technology and Human Existence_, which first ran in first semester, 1993, we asked just what technology is, in what ways it effects us and just how much of a good thing it is. We looked at the views of a few authors who have already addressed this question. And we examined a number of spectacular failures of technological systems, e.g., the _Challenger_ disaster and the _U.S.S. Vincennes_ incident, in order to pose questions concerning the nature and limits of technological control. The question was also raised of whether the increasing complexity which sophisticated technology makes possible is or is not a threat to traditional political ideals such as democratic participation in the political process, the desirability and possibility of a steerable human society governed by substantial normative and ethical visions. Finally, we looked at notions of appropriate/alternative technology in order to see whether there are alternative “philosophies”of technological design and implementation.<br><br/>Two videos were used in connection with the option, viz., _On the Eighth Day_ and _Whatever happened to __Star Wars__. The first looks at how technologies for overcoming infertility use women as guinea pigs for trialling and improving the technologies themselves. The second details the rise and fall of Ronald Reagan's _Strategic Defense Initiative_, revealing in the process something of the politics of large-scale technological projects.<br><br/>These notes were written in 1993 and updated across 1994 and 1995.
