I completed a B.A. (Hons) First Class in Philosophy at Latrobe University in Melbourne, Australia. I then completed a M.A. mit Auszeichnung at the Goethe-Universität, in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I also received my Dr. Phil. (magna cum laude) from the Goethe Universität, with a dissertation on Searle’s Theory of Speech Acts supervised by Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of New South Wales, I taught at the ANU from 1993 until 2000, then at the University of Sydney until 2007. In 2008 I returned to the ANU, where I have been ever since.

I work primarily on German philosophy of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with emphasis on the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger; and in the philosophy of technology and sustainability. But I also have a background in analytical philosophy and in Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Marx and Critical Theory, and Gadamer and hermeneutics.

A crucial part of my work at the ANU is the building of interdisciplinary links to other areas of the ANU relevant to sustainability, in particular, the Fenner School of Environment and Society. I see these as enabling a new kind of engagement for philosophers, beyond the usual round of conferencing, paper-giving, publishing and intra-disciplinary teaching.
