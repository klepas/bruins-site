I completed a B.A. (Hons) First Class in Philosophy at Latrobe University in Melbourne, Australia. I then completed a M.A. mit Auszeichnung at the Goethe-Universität, in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I also received my Dr. Phil. (magna cum laude) from the Goethe Universität, with a dissertation on Searle’s Theory of Speech Acts supervised by Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of New South Wales, I taught at the ANU from 1993 until 2000, then at the University of Sydney until 2007. In 2008 I returned to the ANU, where I have been until August, 2019. I am about to take up a research position at the University of New South Wales.

I work primarily on German philosophy of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with emphasis on the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger; and in the philosophy of technology and sustainability. But I also have a background in analytical philosophy and in Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Marx and Critical Theory, and Gadamer and hermeneutics.

A crucial part of my work is the building of interdisciplinary links to other areas of inquiry relevant to sustainability. I see these as enabling a new kind of engagement for philosophers, beyond the usual round of conferencing, paper-giving, publishing and intra-disciplinary teaching. I am actively engaged in local politics, specifically, on issues of urban consolidation, gentrification and public transport.
