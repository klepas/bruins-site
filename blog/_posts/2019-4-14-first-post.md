Blogging functionality has been added to my website in order to enable me to post quick comments on diverse matters, e.g., responses to comments received on papers or course materials; and comments on topical issues, e.g., concerning development in Canberra.

For example, I hope soon to post some replies to comments made on the op ed I recently published in *The Riot ACT*! See [Barrâ€™s fast track from Bush Capital to concrete jungle](https://the-riotact.com/barrs-fast-track-from-bush-capital-to-concrete-jungle/291626).
