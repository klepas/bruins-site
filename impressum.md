## Legal

In Germany, the Impressum should normally contain legal information with regard to privacy, data retention, liability, the accuracy of content and external links, and so on.

### This website

My writing on this website reflects my own opinions, not that of my employers, past or current.

External links do not constitute endorsements, unless explicitely noted.

For more general information about this website please see the [About page](/about).

### Privacy

I do not collect any information from visitors, aside from what the web hosting provider logs by default (HTTP logs) -- I do not use any web analytics software (e.g. Google Analytics).

Since this website offers no dynamic commenting, the only avenue for sending me any personally identifying information is via email. I will not divulge anything you send me without your permission.
